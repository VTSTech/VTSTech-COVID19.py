 COVID-19 JHU.EDU CSSE Data Analytics by VTSTech (www.VTS-Tech.org) 

Hello,

My name is Nigel Todman, I'm a software developer from Canada. I've written a Python script to parse the JHU CSSE Data from GitHub and produce various stats and metrics. Perhaps this would be useful to yourself or your colleagues. I often found myself making these calculations by hand every day. And now I can produce these stats globally or nationally rather quickly. (or even automatically)
